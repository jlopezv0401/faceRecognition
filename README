Face Recognition

Runs on Mac or Linux

First install OpenCV libraries, make sure that the paths of the .pc files are in the PKG_CONFIG_PATH, so we can use pkg-config command to add and link the OpenCV headears and libraries 

To know the correct path of the headers and libraries use:

pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv

Then use them to compile with g++

g++ -I/opt/local/include -L/opt/local/lib -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_ml -lopencv_video -lopencv_features2d -lopencv_calib3d -lopencv_objdetect -lopencv_contrib -lopencv_legacy -lopencv_flann OnlineFaceRec.cpp -o OnlineFaceRec

Includes in the zip file the original files taken from 
http://www.shervinemami.co.cc/faceRecognition.html

It has all the files to compile and run under Windows using Visual Studio 2008, but needs to configure the proyect to the Headers and the libraries paths.

This version has been modificated to run under Linux and Mac by Jesus Lopez.
